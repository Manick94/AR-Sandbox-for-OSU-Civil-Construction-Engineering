# AR-Sandbox-for-Construction-Planning

The AR sandbox is meant to augment a physical sandbox with additional information overlayed with a projector. Specifically, this project aims to aid in the visualiztion of civil and construction engineering concepts both for collaboration and teaching.

# Installation

This project was built using the Unity game engine. After installing Unity, run the Unity editor. Open a new project, and navigate to the src directory in the local Github repository. Unity should recognize the AR_Sandbox directory contained in the src directory as a Unity project. After opening the project, the program can be run in editor by pressing the play button.
